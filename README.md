# Basics-of-Python
### Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language with an increasing fan base. </br>

For a beginner, understanding how to code can be difficult. It is important to be aware of the internal working of the basic data structures such as loops, control statements, classes, objects, functions, etc. if you want to learn and enter the world of advanced coding.</br>

These pieces of code will help you understand the following important concepts in Python:</br>
  1. Simple operations</br>
  2. Control and looping statements</br>
  3. Data structures: Lists, tuples, and dictionaries </br>
 
I have described related problem statements along with their solutions using object-oriented programming concepts.</br>
