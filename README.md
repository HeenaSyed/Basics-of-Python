# Basics-of-Python
### Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language with an increase fan base. </br>

For a beginner, understanding how to code can be difficult. It is important to be aware of the internal working of loops, control statements, classes, objects, functions, and other data structures if you want to improve and enter the world of advance coding.</br>

These pieces of codes will help you understand some important concepts in Python. I have covered the following concepts:</br>
  1. Simple operations </br>
  2. Control and looping statements </br>
  3. Data structures-Lists, tuples, and dictionaries </br>
 
I have described the problem statements along with their solutions using the object-oriented programming concept.</br>
